# Prime Playground - Verification & Improvement Progress

## Session: 2026-01-20

### Phase 1: Code Verification - COMPLETED
- [x] Build verification - PASSED (all pages compile successfully)
- [x] Lint verification - PASSED (no ESLint warnings or errors)
- [x] Feature page verification:
  - [x] Home/Dashboard - Works correctly
  - [x] Prime Spiral (/spiral) - Works correctly
  - [x] Factor Tree (/factorization) - Works correctly
  - [x] Prime Hunt (/hunt) - Fixed overlay positioning bug
  - [x] Prime Defense (/defense) - Works correctly
  - [x] Cryptarithm (/cryptarithm) - Fixed impossible puzzle
  - [x] Soundscape (/soundscape) - Works correctly
  - [x] Prime Art (/art) - Works correctly

### Phase 2: Bugs Fixed
1. **Mobile nav labels not showing** (mobile-nav.tsx)
   - Issue: Used `xs:inline` class but no xs breakpoint defined
   - Fix: Added xs breakpoint (375px) to tailwind.config.ts

2. **Prime Hunt overlay positioning** (hunt/page.tsx line 93)
   - Issue: Win/lose overlays used absolute positioning without relative parent
   - Fix: Added `relative overflow-hidden` to Card component

3. **Impossible cryptarithm puzzle** (cryptarithm-store.ts lines 38-45)
   - Issue: Puzzle 5 "PRIME + PRIME = PRIME" has no mathematical solution
   - Fix: Replaced with solvable puzzle "AB + BA = CDC" (solution: 47 + 74 = 121)

### Phase 3: UX/UI Improvements
1. **Dashboard cards** (page.tsx)
   - Improved hover states with lift effect and shadow
   - Larger icons with animated scaling on hover
   - Better spacing and visual hierarchy

2. **Prime Hunt feedback** (hunt-store.ts, hunt/page.tsx)
   - Added visual feedback for wrong moves (red flash + shake animation)
   - Clear indication when stepping on composite numbers

3. **Header** (header.tsx)
   - Added logo background container
   - Improved hover states and spacing

4. **Sidebar** (sidebar.tsx)
   - Subtle background tint for visual separation
   - Improved spacing and active state styling

5. **Mobile navigation** (mobile-nav.tsx)
   - Always-visible labels for better usability
   - Improved touch targets (44px min)
   - Better active state indication

6. **Quick Facts section** (page.tsx)
   - Added subtle gradient background
   - Improved typography with monospace numbers

### Phase 4: Final Verification - COMPLETED
- [x] Production build - PASSED
- [x] ESLint - PASSED

## Summary

### Bugs Fixed: 3
- Mobile nav xs breakpoint
- Prime Hunt overlay positioning
- Impossible cryptarithm puzzle

### UX/UI Improvements: 6 areas
- Dashboard cards
- Prime Hunt visual feedback
- Header styling
- Sidebar styling
- Mobile navigation
- Quick Facts section

### Remaining Risks
- Defense game canvas uses hardcoded dark colors (won't adapt to light mode)
- Spiral onWheel preventDefault may not work with passive listeners in some browsers
- No loading states for heavy computations (large prime generation)

### Verified Working
- All 7 interactive features build and run
- All navigation paths work
- State management functions correctly
- Animations and transitions work properly
